III. Materials

Materials will be rendered by the VAT ROP as .mat files. The material parameters in the Houdini VAT - Data group will be automatically filled in. You should probably only use SideFX/VAT_... shader graphs as templates. Duplicate the VAT shader graphs, make your own modifications based on your needs, and re-parent the materials to your customized shaders.
