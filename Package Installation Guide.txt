1. This package requires Unity Version 2021.3.0f1+ (Official Release) and URP 12.0.0+, because several crucial SideFX Labs Vertex Animation Textures 3.0 features depend on Custom Interpolator, which was not added to Unity until 2021.2.0b3 and some beta versions before 2021.3.0f1 would break VAT3 shaders.

2. Launch your Unity project. Open the top-left Assets menu and select "View in Package Manager". On the Package Manager window, click on the top-left "+" button and select "Add package from disk...". Navigate to the directory where this text file is located. Select the file "package" and then click Open. Wait a few seconds for your package to be installed.

3. Your package is now ready. You can find the content of the package on a Project panel, under Assets > SideFX Vertex Animation Textures.
